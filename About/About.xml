    <description>Vanilla Books Expanded is a mod allowing your colonists to pass their knowledge and skill to others. By writing a book about a particular field of science or skill, pawns will transfer their insights and knowledge, and when read, such book will train others in the same skill. Book reading is a new type of joy, with pawns picking up the books best suited for them based on their passions and skillsets, expanding on them whilst getting joy buffs.
	
	Books feature complex descriptions, letting you, the player, know what the book is about in a funny, quirky RimWorld style. Later technologies also allow you to write fiction books and newspapers, providing joy but spoiling at a rapid rate. In addition to that, maps and blueprints can be found with traders - former unlocking quests, and latter unlocking technologies.
